This code was submitted as part of a job application to a 
lab at a large university in Suisse Romande.

There were essentially three challenges:

 1. Implement Schnorr Signatures.
 2. Implement the Schnorr Multiple Signature Scheme.
 3. Implement a given partially blind signature scheme.

In order to separate out clients from servers, basic networking was 
used.

This code won't win any awards for aesthetics and can almost certainly 
be done better. I had not written any Go prior to writing this, so I 
learnt Go on the fly while trying this.
